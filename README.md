# Portfolio [Template]

This repository is an open source portfolio template that I am currently using as a temporary portfolio to showcase my work and projects. The template is designed to be easily customizable and reusable for anyone who wishes to create their own portfolio website.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this template for your own purposes. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
